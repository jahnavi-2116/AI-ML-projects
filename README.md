# Anomaly Detection Assessment
The primary purpose of this project is to explore and apply unsupervised machine learning techniques—specifically clustering and anomaly detection—to detect potentially fraudulent credit card transactions. This project simulates a more realistic approach where we aim to identify suspicious patterns without needing prior knowledge of what constitutes fraud. The project begins by loading and preprocessing the dataset to scale the features appropriately and prepare it for analysis. We then perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of fraud and non-fraud transactions, identifying key features that may indicate fraudulent behavior. This is followed by clustering using KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering to group transactions based on similarity and examine if fraud patterns emerge naturally in any clusters. The core of the project is in Step 5, where we implement anomaly detection techniques like Isolation Forest and Z-Score. These models are applied to a sample of the data to flag transactions that deviate significantly from normal behavior. We evaluate these models using confusion matrices and classification metrics to compare their ability to balance false positives and false negatives. Finally, we use PCA-based visualizations to illustrate how these methods separate normal and potentially fraudulent transactions in a 2D space.
Ultimately, the goal of the project is to build a foundational understanding of how unsupervised models can be used in fraud detection systems—where anomalies, not labels, often drive action—and to provide interpretable, visual, and measurable insights that support intelligent financial decision-making.

# MBA Analysis Assessment
The goal of this project is to explore and demonstrate how Market Basket Analysis (MBA) can be effectively used to discover meaningful associations between items purchased together in transaction data—particularly groceries in this case. Using the Apriori algorithm, the project identifies frequent item combinations and generates association rules that help explain customer buying behavior in terms of "if-then" relationships (e.g., if a customer buys bread, they are likely to buy milk).
Initially, the original dataset had structural issues that prevented proper MBA execution. To overcome this, a new sample dataset was created based on the original format, grouping items by transaction (via member number and date) and converting them into a one-hot encoded structure, which is required by the Apriori algorithm. Once this format was established, the project successfully identified frequent itemsets and generated association rules based on configurable parameters such as minimum support and minimum confidence. To enhance usability and interaction, a Gradio web application was built, allowing users to dynamically adjust these parameters and view the resulting association rules instantly. This interactive interface makes it easier to understand how different combinations of items co-occur, how strong their relationships are (confidence), and how much more likely they are to appear together than by random chance (lift).
Overall, this project showcases how unsupervised learning techniques like Apriori and tools like Gradio can help retailers optimize product placement, cross-sell strategies, and personalized recommendations—ultimately enhancing both customer satisfaction and business profitability.

# EDA & Clustering Assessment
The primary purpose of this project is to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and unsupervised clustering techniques to customer data to uncover meaningful patterns in consumer behavior. Using a dataset containing customer attributes like gender, annual income, and spending score, the project aims to group similar customers together—helping businesses understand their audience and make data-driven decisions in marketing, product placement, and customer engagement strategies. The first part of the project involves thorough EDA, where the distribution of income and spending is visualized using scatter plots, box plots, and violin plots. These visualizations help highlight trends, outliers, and gender-based differences in spending behavior. This step is critical for building intuition about the data and selecting appropriate features for modeling. Following EDA, the project applies KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative Clustering) to group customers based on their income and spending patterns. The clusters aim to segment customers into distinct groups—such as high-income high-spending, low-income low-spending, or average shoppers—without any prior labels. This segmentation allows targeted strategies in promotions or personalized offers. To make the clustering insights interactive and accessible, a Gradio web application is built. It enables users to input their income and spending score using sliders, and instantly view which cluster they belong to under both KMeans and Hierarchical methods. This interface enhances the usability of the model and demonstrates how clustering can be applied in real-time to new customer data.
