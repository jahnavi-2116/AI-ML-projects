**Anomaly Detection assessment **
The primary purpose of this project is to explore and apply unsupervised machine learning techniques—specifically clustering and anomaly detection—to detect potentially fraudulent credit card transactions. This project simulates a more realistic approach where we aim to identify suspicious patterns without needing prior knowledge of what constitutes fraud. The project begins by loading and preprocessing the dataset to scale the features appropriately and prepare it for analysis. We then perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of fraud and non-fraud transactions, identifying key features that may indicate fraudulent behavior. This is followed by clustering using KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering to group transactions based on similarity and examine if fraud patterns emerge naturally in any clusters. The core of the project is in Step 5, where we implement anomaly detection techniques like Isolation Forest and Z-Score. These models are applied to a sample of the data to flag transactions that deviate significantly from normal behavior. We evaluate these models using confusion matrices and classification metrics to compare their ability to balance false positives and false negatives. Finally, we use PCA-based visualizations to illustrate how these methods separate normal and potentially fraudulent transactions in a 2D space.
Ultimately, the goal of the project is to build a foundational understanding of how unsupervised models can be used in fraud detection systems—where anomalies, not labels, often drive action—and to provide interpretable, visual, and measurable insights that support intelligent financial decision-making.
